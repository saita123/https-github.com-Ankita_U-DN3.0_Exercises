Explore and document the new features introduced in Spring Boot 3.

Spring Boot 3 is a major release of the Spring Boot framework, released in November 2022. It includes several new features, improvements and bug fixes:
Java 17 baseline: Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17 or higher. This means you can take advantage of the latest features and performance improvements that Java 17 offers.
Support for generating native images with GraalVM: GraalVM is a high-performance virtual machine that can be used to generate native images of your Spring Boot applications. This can significantly improve the performance of your applications, especially on startup.
Improved observability with Micrometer and Micrometer Tracing: Micrometer is a library that provides a unified API for collecting metrics from your Spring Boot applications. Micrometer Tracing is a library that provides tracing support for your Spring Boot applications. These libraries make it easier to monitor and troubleshoot your applications.
Support for Jakarta EE 10 with an EE 9 baseline: Jakarta EE 10 is the latest version of the Jakarta EE specification. Spring Boot 3 includes support for Jakarta EE 10, so you can now use Spring Boot to develop applications that are compliant with the Jakarta EE 10 specification.
Spring Framework 6: Spring Boot 3 is based on Spring Framework 6, so it includes all of the new features and improvements that were introduced in Spring Framework 6.
Spring Boot applications can be converted into a Native Image using GraalVM 22.3 or above.
Images can be created using the native build tools Gradle/Maven plugins or the native-image tool provided by GraalVM. We can also create native images using the native-image Paketo build pack.
Spring Boot 3 also works well and has been tested with JDK 19.
Spring Boot 3 has migrated from Java JEE to Jakarta JEE APIs for almost all dependencies.
